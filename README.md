<p>:point_up: As we explained before, the state belongs to the component itself. The state of a component can be changed only by the functions created directly in that component.</p>

<p>If a state variable is holding an array or an object, we should first copy it. Then we update the copy and, at last, use the state updater function to update the state.</p>


```bash

echo "# react-lifting-state-up" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:thusspokedata/react-lifting-state-up.git
git push -u origin main

```
